# 🐍Python-Project--2
# Project Name - Password Strength Checker using Python Programming Language

#### 📝**Overview:**

The Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of passwords and help users create secure login credentials. With cyber threats on the rise, having a strong password is crucial to protect personal and sensitive information. This application analyzes a password based on multiple criteria and provides feedback on its robustness.

#### 📌**Objectives:**

* To assist users in creating strong and secure passwords.
* To educate users about the importance of password complexity.
* To provide immediate feedback on password weaknesses.
* To reduce vulnerability to cyber attacks such as hacking or brute-force attacks.

#### ✨**Features:**

* Real-time password strength evaluation.
* Checks for the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* Provides a strength score or classification (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong).
* Suggests improvements for weak passwords.
* Easy-to-use interface with clear results.

#### 🛠️**Technologies Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries/Modules:** `re` (regular expressions), `string` (optional for character checks)

#### 📚**Topic Covered in This Project:**   
* Function
* Conditional Statement
* Loops
* Input and Output Handling
* Strings Manipulation
* Import Library(Regular Expressions)
* Logic Validation

#### ⚙️**Working Principle:**

1. The user inputs a password.
2. The program evaluates the password based on predefined criteria:

   * Minimum length
   * Presence of uppercase letters
   * Presence of lowercase letters
   * Inclusion of numbers
   * Inclusion of special characters
3. Each criterion contributes to the overall strength score.
4. The program outputs the password strength (Weak, Medium, Strong) along with suggestions for improvement if necessary.

#### 🏆**Conclusion:**

The Password Strength Checker is a practical and educational tool that helps users understand the components of a strong password. By providing immediate feedback and suggestions, it encourages better security practices and reduces the risk of unauthorized access. This project demonstrates the effective use of Python for solving real-world security challenges.
